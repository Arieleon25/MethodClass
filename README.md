# MethodClass

The MethodClass project is a console application that demonstrates the usage of a void method in a class. It includes a method that performs a math operation on one integer and displays another integer to the screen.

# Project Description
The MethodClass project consists of a single file, Program.cs.

Program.cs

This file contains the Program class and a separate MathOperations class.

The MathOperations class contains a void method called PerformMathOperation that takes two integers as parameters. Inside the method, it performs a math operation on the first integer and displays the second integer to the console.

The Program class is where the Main method resides. In the Main method, an instance of the MathOperations class is created.

The PerformMathOperation method is called twice in the Main method. In the first call, two numbers are passed as arguments. In the second call, the parameters are specified by name.

# Instructions
Start the console application.

The program will instantiate the MathOperations class.

The PerformMathOperation method will be called, passing in two numbers. The method will perform a math operation on the first number and display the second number to the console.

The method will be called again, specifying the parameters by name. This allows you to pass the numbers in a different order.

The program will terminate.

You can rerun the program to test different scenarios and see the output for different number combinations.

# Skills Demonstrated
This project demonstrates the following skills and concepts related to methods in C#:

Creating a void method in a separate class

Passing parameters to a method

Specifying parameters by name in a method call
